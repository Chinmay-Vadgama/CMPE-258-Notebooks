I) Do write autodiff python  library (we discussed in class)  and based on it , do  mnist classifier in colab (similar to last exercise but using autodiff library  that you will write instead of direct numpy) - DO NOT COPY PASTE FROM BOOK. WRITE CLEAN CUSTOM CODE WITH YOUR OWN CLASS NAMES AND VARIABLE NAMES FROM SCRATCH. 

II) do keras models for four problems (4 different data sets)

a) boolean cross entropy

b) sparse categorical crossentropy (softmax) - try to get images of 7 classes with images.google.com google search and classify 

c) logistic regression

d) multi head classification (multi class classification)

Do not copy from medium or existing colabs. do it from scratch (we will run turnitin).

 

Write proper colabs (points based on how cleanly and well documented your colabs are. checkout the tensorflow.org tutorial colabs as a template (i shared in announcement). Proper integration with tensorboard and metrics visualization. Proper visualize the input samples, results, losses, confusion matrices etc.. (just like fastai kind of colabs).

 

Pick problems from either kaggle or from paperwithcode.com for this exercise.

Try to use as many advanced  features of keras as possible 

Ensure you do dropout, early stopping and l2 regularization techniques 
Ensure you use proper network initialization and optimizer (see keras api) and proper activation functions in each layer.

Ensure you use proper number of neurons and proper layers 

Use mini batching and write your custom callbacks for printing custom metrics

Explore and use both functional api and sequential api.

 

Use https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner (Links to an external site.) for hyperparam tuning

 

Submit each of the model colab seperately (also onrender example web app link) in single directory (directory name is assignment 2).

 

Also checkin github the modelcards showcasing your work for each model - only evaluation section is mandatory - fairness stuff is not.
