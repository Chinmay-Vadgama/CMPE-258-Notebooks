a) Implement (i) keras based models for classifying using CNN planet amazon data set 

 

See https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson3-planet.ipynb?authuser=1#scrollTo=-XOcH94uQjPM (Links to an external site.) (this implements pytorch) - I want keras model !! not pytorch - students will get zero points if they submit pytorch one) for more information.

Try out various hyper parameters. provide detailed comments in colab with various experiments. 

Please implement from scratch and not copy

50% points will be to provide tensorboard integration and trying out various layers/activation functions/other hyperparams like optimizers - Please submit the tensorboard result to tensorboard.dev


## Tensorboard Integration Link
**Note : Downloaded ipynb files don't have Tensorboard results. They ommit tensorboard integration. So, please go to original ipynb notebook on google colab : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g4BJUxYQsfptxnPMzgvO25Va9v-WUIld?usp=sharing**
